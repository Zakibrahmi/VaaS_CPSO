# Vehicle-as-a-Service Composition using Composite Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of the solution proposed in the paper:  
**"Vehicle as a Service: Multi-modal Transportation Service Selection with Composite Particle Swarm Optimization"** *(currently under review)*.

The solution is designed to generate a **Vehicle-as-a-Service (VaaS) Composition** in **Smart Urban Networks**, focusing on efficient multi-modal transportation service selection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
