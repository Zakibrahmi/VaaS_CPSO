# Vehicle-as-a-Service Composition using Composite Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of the solution proposed in the paper:  
**"Vehicle as a Service: Multi-modal Transportation Service Selection with Composite Particle Swarm Optimization"** *(currently under review)*.

The solution is designed to generate a **Vehicle-as-a-Service (VaaS) Composition** in **Smart Urban Networks**, focusing on efficient multi-modal transportation service selection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Code

To execute the solution, run the following command while commited instruction according to the scenario to be executed:
```bash
python main.py
```

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
